Simple Config Manager
=====================
A simple config parser build on top of the standard python configparser module
that eases the use of config files.
It is designed for a single config file. Sections are added if needed and
options are immediatly saved to disk whenever you change a option with "set()".
It also adds the methods "getlist" and "add_to_list" to handle lists.

Furthermore, you can also specify the delimiters in the python2 version.
